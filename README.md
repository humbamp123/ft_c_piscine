# c_piscine

Hello visitor!
These are the c execrises used for the 42 School C Piscine, which is a coding boot camp lasting about a month.
I was learning at the time, so I make no promise any of these work and have no plan to update them.

If you are looking for a more solid example of my work something for the full curriculum should be on my page.

Thanks for stopping by!

## If you are in the C Piscine at 42 or any spin-off, CODE THIS ON YOUR OWN!
Your skill as a coder will thank you.
